# SIIT-W5-Homework-RPS
Rock Paper Scissors game using basic JS

Rock, Paper, Scissors.html contains my first attempt at resolving the homework, where I repeat the same code twice for each player (computer & user).
This lead me to write the 2nd file, RPS-DRY.html in which I store both players in an array (whether the code is actually DRY is debatable).
